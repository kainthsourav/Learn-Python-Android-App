<h1>Python - Loops</h1>
<p>In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on. There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code several number of times.</p>
<p>Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.</p>
<p>A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times.</p>
<p>Python programming language provides following types of loops to handle looping requirements.</p>

<th style="text-align:center;">Sr.No.</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Loop Type &amp; Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;vertical-align:middle;">1</td>
<td><p><b>while loop</b></p>
<p>Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is TRUE. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;vertical-align:middle;">2</td>
<td><p><b>for loop</b></p>
<p>Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;vertical-align:middle;">3</td>
<td><p><b>nested loops</b></p>
<p>You can use one or more loop inside any another while, for or do..while loop.</p></td>
</tr>

<h2>Loop Control Statements</h2>
<p>Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.</p>
<p>Python supports the following control statements. Click the following links to check their detail.</p>

<th style="text-align:center;">Sr.No.</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Control Statement &amp; Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;vertical-align:middle;">1</td>
<td><p><b>break statement</b></p>
<p>Terminates the loop statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;vertical-align:middle;">2</td>
<td><p><b>continue statement</b></p>
<p>Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;vertical-align:middle;">3</td>
<td><p><b>pass statement</b></p>
<p>The pass statement in Python is used when a statement is required syntactically but you do not want any command or code to execute.</p></td>
