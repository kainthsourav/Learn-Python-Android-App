<h1>Python - Overview</h1>
<p>Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Python is Interpreted</b> &minus; Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Python is Interactive</b> &minus; You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Python is Object-Oriented</b> &minus; Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Python is a Beginner's Language</b> &minus; Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>History of Python</h2>
<p>Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late eighties and early nineties at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Python is derived from many other languages, including ABC, Modula-3, C, C++, Algol-68, SmallTalk, and Unix shell and other scripting languages.</p>
<p>Python is copyrighted. Like Perl, Python source code is now available under the GNU General Public License (GPL).</p>
<p>Python is now maintained by a core development team at the institute, although Guido van Rossum still holds a vital role in directing its progress.</p>
<h2>Python Features</h2>
<p>Python's features include &minus;</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Easy-to-learn</b> &minus; Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Easy-to-read</b> &minus; Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Easy-to-maintain</b> &minus; Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.</p></li>
<li><p><b>A broad standard library</b> &minus; Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Interactive Mode:</b>Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Portable</b> &minus; Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Extendable</b> &minus; You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Databases</b> &minus; Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.</p></li>
<li><p><b>GUI Programming</b> &minus; Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Scalable</b> &minus; Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from the above-mentioned features, Python has a big list of good features, few are listed below &minus;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.</p></li>
<li><p>It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.</p></li>
<li><p>It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.</p></li>
<li><p>IT supports automatic garbage collection.</p></li>
<li><p>It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.</p></li>
</ul>
